Hey there! 

I'm Daniel, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of South Florida.
I have done two SWE internships at Google, which have allowed me to work on large scale products that serve millions of users such as Google Chat.
Additionally, I have worked on several personal projects such as:
  1) A fully functional compiler for a custom programming language inspired by Java. This project is in a private repository because it was done as a class project for an elective Compilers course at my school. The source code has more than 3,000 lines of code :)
  2) A banking platform that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds across multiple bank accounts and view their transaction history.
  3) A stock trading web application that uses real time stock data and allows users to simulate stock trading and learn without any consequences.
