Hey there! 

I'm Daniel, a fourth-year Computer Science student at the University of South Florida.
I have done two SWE internships at Google, which have allowed me to work on large scale products that serve millions of users such as Google Chat.
Additionally, I have worked on several group and personal projects such as:
  1) A fully functional compiler for a custom programming language inspired by Java. This project is in a private repository because it's an extension of a class project for an elective Compilers course at my school. The source code has more than 4,000 lines of code :)
  2) A distributed key-value storage service written in Go. The project contains an implementation of the Raft consensus algorithm for state replication. It can recover from server crashes and network partitions by keeping a log of all operations applied on the primary replica, and sending them to all other services to achieve fault tolerance and consistency.
  3) A banking platform that allows users to deposit, withdraw, and transfer funds across multiple bank accounts and view their transaction history.
  4) A command line interface that simulates a social media platform similar to LinkedIn, but for college students, called InCollege. This project was developed by a group of 5 students in an Agile environment leveraging Jira, Python, Pytest and SQL.
  5) A stock trading web application that uses real time stock data and allows users to simulate stock trading and learn without any consequences.
